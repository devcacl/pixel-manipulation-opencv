# 🖼️ Pixel Manipulation and Coordinates with OpenCV

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of **Computer Vision** using **Python and OpenCV**.  
It includes pixel manipulation, histogram analysis, shape drawing, edge detection, and geometric transformations.

The work was developed in **Google Colab** as an academic practice.

## 📌 Project Contents

### 1️⃣ Pixel manipulation and coordinates
- Direct pixel region modification
- Drawing a 50x50 red square
- Drawing a green horizontal line at the center of the image
- Use of `(x, y)` coordinates to access pixels

---

### 2️⃣ Color histograms
- Histograms of **Blue, Green, and Red (BGR)** channels
- Conversion to grayscale
- Grayscale intensity histogram
- Comparison between color channel histograms and grayscale histogram

---

### 3️⃣ Drawing geometric shapes
- Blue circle at the center of the image
- Yellow rectangle in the bottom-right corner
- Red diagonal line
- Use of OpenCV drawing functions

---

### 4️⃣ Computer vision: Canny and contours
- Grayscale conversion
- Gaussian blur for noise reduction
- Edge detection using **Canny**
- Contour detection
- Bounding box drawing for detected objects

---

### 5️⃣ Geometric transformations
- Image resizing (half and double size)
- Rotations of 45° and 90°
- Manual translation using matrices
- Horizontal and vertical reflection
